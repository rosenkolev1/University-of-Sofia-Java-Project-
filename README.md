# University of Sofia Java Project for Modern Java Technologies Course 

A Java project I created for the Modern Java Technologies Course based on the following page: https://github.com/fmi/java-course/blob/master/course-projects/battleships.md

Additionally, I added support for multiple enemies to be able to join a single game and all play against each other in a free-for-all.
